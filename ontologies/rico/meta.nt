As the third part of Records in Contexts standard, it\n                    is a formal representation of Records in Contexts Conceptual Model (RiC-CM).\n                    This version, which is v1.0.2, is the latest official release. It is compliant\n                    with RiC-CM v1.0.</html:p>\n                <html:p>The following diagram shows the main RiC-CM 1.0 entities and a few relations\n                    between them: <html:img src=\"https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/blob/7bc6d5d59ecc85a4b901cc79d649ae50209fd69e/diagrams/diagrams_v1-0/RiC-CM-overview/diagram_RiC-CM-overview-RiC-v1-0.jpg?raw=true\" alt=\"A partial overview of RiC-CM 1.0 main entities\" class=\"diagram\"></html:img>\n                </html:p>\n                <html:div id=\"design-principles\">\n                    <html:h4>RiC-O design principles</html:h4>\n                    <html:p>The following design principles were followed when developing\n                        RiC-O.</html:p>\n                    <html:p>\n                        <html:strong>1. RiC-O is a domain and reference\n                        ontology</html:strong>.</html:p>\n                    <html:p>RiC-O provides <html:strong>a generic vocabulary and formal rules for\n                            creating RDF datasets (or generating them from existing archival\n                            metadata) that describe in a consistent way any kind of archival record\n                            resource</html:strong>. It supports publishing RDF datasets as Linked\n                        Data, querying them using SPARQL, and making inferences using the logic of\n                        the ontology.</html:p>\n                    <html:p>While some projects have built some specific ontologies for describing\n                        archives, in 2013 no generic domain ontology existed for the specific needs\n                        of the archival community. This is why EGAD decided to develop RiC-O as a\n                        part of RiC standard.</html:p>\n                    <html:p>Apart from this first, main target, <html:strong>RiC-O, as a technical\n                            implementation of RiC-CM that also extends and refines it and that\n                            includes formal logic, can guide or inspire, in many ways, the\n                            development of any tool or system that manages (i.e. stores, enables to\n                            edit or processes) and publishes descriptive archival\n                            metadata.</html:strong>. Of course, other technical implementations of\n                        RiC-CM may be developed later on. Also, the current technical\n                        implementations of the former ICA standards, e.g. EAD and EAC-CPF XML\n                        schemas, should be made closer to RiC-CM in the future; on this topic, see\n                            <html:a href=\"https://www2.archivists.org/groups/technical-subcommittee-on-encoded-archival-standards-ts-eas\">the news and announcements of the Technical Subcommittee on Encoded\n                            Archival Standards (TS-EAS) of the Society of American\n                            Archivists</html:a>.</html:p>\n                    <html:p>As RiC-O is a generic, domain ontology, <html:strong>it does not address\n                            by itself every specific need or expectation</html:strong> that may\n                        occur in every archival institution or project. It is rather <html:strong>a\n                            high level framework</html:strong> and an institution or project\n                        implementing RiC-O can apply only such a subset of properties as meets their\n                        needs, or extend the specification according to their particular\n                        requirements, or do both.</html:p>\n                    <html:p>As a domain ontology, RiC-O, at this stage, does not borrow from other\n                        existing ontologies (such as the cultural heritage models – IFLA-LRM and\n                        CIDOC-CRM, PREMIS, or PROV-O). It should therefore be easier, for an\n                        archival institution or archival project, to understand, implement and\n                        maintain RiC-O within its system.</html:p>\n                    <html:p>Alignment with those and other models, where possible, will be\n                        undertaken in a future revision cycle to support the interconnected nature\n                        of resource description across the domains. This is of course essential for\n                        interconnecting RDF datasets conforming to RiC-O with other datasets, or for\n                        using parts of RiC-O in other contexts than the archival or records\n                        management realm.</html:p>\n                    <html:p>\n                        <html:strong>2.

Converting existing archival metadata\n                        created or generated in current information systems and compliant with ICA\n                        standards to RDF/RiC-O is possible without losing data or\n                        structure.</html:p>\n                    <html:p>During the ongoing development process of RiC-O, intensive conversion\n                        testing, either by hand or using scripts, was conducted on XML/EAD finding\n                        aids and XML/EAC-CPF authority records to ensure that RiC-O is usable with\n                        existing descriptive metadata. An <html:a href=\"https://github.com/ArchivesNationalesFR/rico-converter\">open\n                            source conversion software</html:a> was also developed and made\n                        available in April 2020.</html:p>\n                    <html:p>While some existing metadata sets may have a very fine level of\n                        granularity and accuracy, already using, for example, controlled\n                        vocabularies, or describing curation events separately, often these metadata\n                        don’t have the very precise structure that RiC-CM recommends. Even then,\n                        such a conversion process remains possible. In order to allow this, RiC-O\n                        sometimes provides several methods for representing information (as\n                        described below). From this point of view, RiC-O v1.0 may be considered a\n                        transitional ontology, in which some components may be deprecated later\n                        on.</html:p>\n                    <html:p>The usability of a model also depends on its documentation. RiC-O is\n                        documented extensively. The documentation will be reviewed and updated on a\n                        continuing basis.</html:p>\n                    <html:p>\n                        <html:strong>3. RiC-O provides a flexible framework</html:strong>.</html:p>\n                    <html:p>\n                        <html:strong>This is a very important principle too</html:strong>. It is\n                        related with the usability principle quoted above. Moreover,\n                            <html:strong>archival description is flexible by essence</html:strong>.\n                        It is quite commonly noted that today the level of granularity of\n                        information varies from one finding aid to another (or from one authority\n                        record to another), or even within the same finding aid. Some series or\n                        agents are described summarily because little is known about them and there\n                        is little time for extensive research, while other series, even records, or\n                        agents are described in detail; some relations (e.g. that relating to\n                        provenance) may be described without any detail while others may be\n                        thoroughly documented, as ISAAR(CPF) and EAC-CPF allow it.</html:p>\n                    <html:p>Being generally flexible, for an OWL ontology, depends first on the\n                        polyhierarchical systems of classes and properties it provides. A\n                        superproperty or superclass, more general or generic than its subproperties\n                        or subclasses, must exist and be available for handling information, while\n                        at the same time more accurate subcomponents must be there for handling more\n                        accurate description. Also, RiC-O provides methods for describing relations\n                        as full entities, as well as direct and short paths between\n                        entities.</html:p>\n                    <html:p>\n                        <html:strong>4. RiC-O opens new potential for archival\n                            description.</html:strong>\n                    </html:p>\n                    <html:p><html:strong>Linked Data tools and interfaces enable end users to go\n                            through RDF/RiC-O graphs, query them using SPARQL, and make inferences.\n                            This means a completely new way of consulting archival metadata and\n                            their multiple contexts.</html:strong> An end user should be able to ask\n                        of any given data set, for example, “What are (according to your dataset)\n                        the corporate bodies that succeeded a given entity from its end of existence\n                        to now (as concerns this given activity)?”, or “what instantiations of this\n                        photograph exist?”, or “what are the existing copies of this original\n                        charter?”, and get a list of these entities. This means that institutions or\n                        projects that invest in the implementation of RiC-O will be able to query\n                        their data in ways not possible with the previous ICA standards, and will\n                        get new insight into the content and context of their archives that wasn’t\n                        visible with the existing ICA-standards. What is more, repositories using\n                        RiC-O may infer new assertions from the RDF datasets and link them to other\n                        resources outside their institution, thereby amplifying the query and\n                        inferencing possibilities manifold.</html:p>\n                    <html:p>\n                        <html:strong>5. RiC-O is extensible.</html:strong>\n                    </html:p>\n                    <html:p>Institutions with descriptive needs beyond what RiC-O provides\n                        out-of-the-box have the option of extending the ontology by adding new\n                        subclasses or subproperties as needed. Also, the concepts defined in\n                        existing SKOS vocabularies (e.g. a list of documentary form types) can also\n                        be connected to RiC-O based graphs (using the *Type classes, and properties\n                        which are in the domain or range of these classes).</html:p>\n                    <html:p>RiC-O has also the potential to be usable in other contexts than purely\n                        archival ones. It can be used to “hook” archival description to descriptive\n                        metadata in other domains (e.g. bibliographic or museum metadata). As said\n                        above, alignment with other models will be undertaken by EGAD in a future\n                        revision cycle, facilitating such connections.</html:p>\n                </html:div>\n                <html:div id=\"understanding-RiCO\">\n                    <html:h4>Understanding RiC-O: a quick overview of some features</html:h4>\n                    <html:div id=\"fromRiCCM-to-RiCO\">\n                        <html:h5>From RiC-CM to RiC-O</html:h5>\n                        <html:div id=\"From_RiC-CM_components_to_RiC-O_classes\">\n                            <html:h6>1.

Some projects may need very few of\n                                them (e.g. Agent, Record Resource and Activity only), while others\n                                may need more (e.g. Corporate Body and Person; Record; Place;\n                                Organic Provenance Relation).</html:p>\n                            <html:p><html:strong>Many classes only exist in RiC-O and not in\n                                    RiC-CM</html:strong>.
