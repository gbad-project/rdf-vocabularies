<https://prefix.zazuko.com/cert:> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Ontology for Certificates and crypto stuff.\n   This is in development. \n   Some other ontologies to look at:\n     * http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/crypto\n        + has cwm builtins: http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/Trust\n        - a bit old perhaps. It imports daml+oil\n        - would help to be more completely specified\n        - uses literals as subjects a little liberally, which makes this a \n        bit difficult to work with frameworks that don't permit this\n     * http://xmlns.com/wot/0.1/\n        - limited very much to PGP (though on can map PGP to X509)\n        - a little coarse grained, mixes up the PGP certificate with the PGP\n          public key\n     *\n   Todo: \n     - add some classes and relations for DSA\n     - should this all be in one file? Or should this be cut up a little? Say one file for the general CERT ontology, and then files for RSA, DSA, PGP, etc... Or perhaps it does not really matter?\n     - expand more on the certification side of things\n     - verify this by security experts\n     - owl2 has some constructs for combined inverse functional properties. \n       This may be useful to use in defining an RSA key which is identified\n       by two numbers.\n     - also create html version of the spec by using this as a template.\n     - should comments such as this be in html?" .
